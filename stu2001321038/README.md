# Project Roadmap + Monetization update

## Създадох проект в Jira - https://uni-plovdiv-stu2001321038.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/NAEN/boards/4/timeline
В него създадох timeline с user stories, които са разпределени в epics и после са разпределени по спринтове от 3 седмици със стартова и крайна дата. Първият спринт е стартиран и неговият прогрес може да се види и на board.<br>
Първите 5 epics са направени да са последователни по за разработка а 6тият добавя функционалности на администраторите за мониторинг на системата и user stories от него съм ги сложил за изпълнение след като се добавят функционалностите, които наблюдават.
С всеки спринт съм се опитвал да създам работеща версия на проекта с добавени функционалности (поради количеството работа на някои места създаването на обект и неговото преглеждане от външни акаунти е разделено на два отделни спринта).

## Подробно описание на разпределението
**Sprint 1**
- *Epic 1* - Add Register and Login
	- As a user I want to be able to create an account and log in so I can access the materials, which are personalized to me.
	- As a coach I want to be able to create an account and log in so I can provide useful materials to and communicate with the users.
- *Epic 6* - Add administrator monitoring functionalities
	- As an administrator I want to be able to see when user/coach accounts were created, when they were accessed and from where so I can prevent account theft and to stop banned users/coaches from creating new accounts.
	
**Sprint 2**
- *Epic 2* - Add CRUD for Materials
	- As an administrator I want to be able to create, read, update and delete any of the digital materials on the platform so I ensure the correct usage of the platform and the materials within it.
	- As a coach I want to be able to create, read, update and delete materials on the platform so I can improve the lives of the users.

**Sprint 3**
- *Epic 3* - Add Personalization options for users
	- As a user I want to be able to subscribe to areas of interest (such as "relationship advice") so I can more easily get materials to improve on those areas.
	- As a user I want to be able to create collections of materials, which I can share with others so I can more easily access materials I have found useful or are from people I respect.
- *Epic 6* - Add administrator monitoring functionalities
	- As an administrator I want to be able to see which materials have been accessed and added to private collections the most so I can take into account what most users are interested in.

**Sprint 4**
- *Epic 4* - Add Chat Rooms
	- As a coach I want to be able to create personalized and group private rooms so I can communicate with the users and address their questions concerning the topics I cover.
	- As a user I want to be able to join personalized and group private rooms so I can communicate with the coaches and other users and improve my life with their help.

**Sprint 5**
- *Epic 5* - Add Premium Features
	- As a coach I want to be able to live stream my speeches/lessons which can be accessed by paid subscription users so I can earn money.
	- As a coach I want to be able to upload VODs from the live streams as well as materials which can be accesses early by paid subscription users so I can earn money.
	- As a user I want to be able to donate money to the web app so I can show my support and they can have the money to further develop it.

**Sprint 6**
- *Epic 5* - Add Premium Features
	- As a user I want to be able to go on the paid subscription plan so I can attend live streams from the coaches so I can interact with them directly and have my questions answered live.
	- As a user I want to be able to go on the paid subscription plan so I can have early access to VODs from streams as well as early access to uploaded video, audio and written materials.
	- As a user I want if I am on the paid subscription plan to not have ads be shown so I can consume the content that I am now paying for undisturbed.

**Sprint 7**
- *Epic 6* - Add administrator monitoring functionalities
	- As an administrator I want to be able to see where reports for issues with registration and account theft are reported the most so I can address the problem.
	- As an administrator I want to be able to see which coaches are the most watched the most so I can take into account how do their presentations and potentially provide more tools to assist them.
	- As an administrator I want to be able to see which coach's materials are used the most (accessed and added to collections) so I can figure out a connection between presentation and materials provided.

## Лека промяна в схемата за печелене на пари
Начинът ни на печелене на пари се осланяше до сега на дарения, платен абонамент и гледане на реклами. Това не се е променило, но разширих позитивите от платеният абонамент да включват ранни запоси от стриймове и ранен достъп до нови материали.
